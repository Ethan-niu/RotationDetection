Introduction to Rotation Detection
===================================

Arbitrary-oriented objects are ubiquitous for detection across visual datasets, such as aerial images, scene text, face and 3D objects, retail scenes, etc.
Compared with the large literature on horizontal object detection, research in oriented object detection is relatively in its earlier stage, with many open problems to solve.

Rotation detection techniques have been applied to the following applications:

* Aerial images

  .. image:: ../images/aerial.png

* Scene text

  .. image:: ../images/text.png

* face

  .. image:: ../images/face.png

* 3D object detection

  .. image:: ../images/3d.png

* Retail scenes

  .. image:: ../images/retail.png

* and more...
